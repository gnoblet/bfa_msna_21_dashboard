# BFA_MSNA_21 - Dashboard

This a very-uncomplete-unclean repository for the dashboard published at :

https://reach-info.org/bfa/msna

Many things to be improved:

1. clean up unnecessary things, code, packages, etc.;
2. add utils and dashboard_f to package `impactR`: mostly or all done
3. try to move from `leaflet` to `tmap`, easier to write and read, though one needs to tackle the issue of legend format beforehand.
